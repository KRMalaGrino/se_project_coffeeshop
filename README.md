# The Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. A website all about the coffee shop!

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The menu block should come after the recipes block & before the book-a-table block . It feels better this way . Just a suggestion / recommendation for the team . What does everyone think ?
