The official website of "The Coffee Shop" located inside "Triple Peaks Library" . This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. A website all about the coffee shop!

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5

## Plan on improving the project

The menu block should come after the recipes block & before the book-a-table block . It feels better this way . Just a suggestion / recommendation for the team . What does everyone think ? 

## Technologies & techniques

We created this website using a reference from TripleTen's website to replicate the layouts, typographies and other important details . VSCode was the coding application used . Solely html & css files .
